## what is ServerAlias
- is the associated names of the ServerName. I believe it redirects back to the
server name. So for examples
```
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName jermaineforbes.com
        ServerAlias www.jermaineforbes.com
```
- when I put www.jermaineforbes.com it will direct the alias back to the domain of 
jermaineforbes.com
